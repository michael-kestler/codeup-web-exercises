/*example input: [5,8,2,6,9,3,2];
expected output: [2,2,3,5,6,8,9] // length: 7
some possible test cases to think about:
should be called ‘sortArr’
function should return an array
function should accept an array
BONUS thoughts
what would happen if you had negative numbers in your list
can you sort and then remove any duplicates
(would it be more/less efficient to remove duplicates and then sort?)
 if your array has non-numbers can you still sort the numbers? ex: input:
 [3,“b”,8,5,9,true”, 4,“xyz”] expected output: [3,4,5,8,9];
 */

function sortArr(input){
    if (typeof input === "object"){
        return input.sort();

    }
}

sortArr([2,2,3,5,6,8,9])
